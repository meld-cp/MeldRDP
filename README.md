# Meld RDP
**A Fast, Portable Remote Desktop Manager**

**Meld RDP** is a lightweight, portable application designed to simplify the management of
your remote desktop (RDP) connections. I built this tool to solve a problem I faced,
existing RDP managers were either too slow, too complex, or lacked portability.  

I believe this tool will be useful to many others, which is why Iâ€™m sharing it with the
community. If it helps you, please consider [buying me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/cleon).
The link can also be found directly within the application.  

**Note:** The software is free for personal use. However, by contributing PRs or donating to
the project, you are free to use it commercially. This helps ensure the project's long-term
sustainability. For more details, see the [license](LICENCE.md).

- Once the RDP edit window is closed, a simpler edit window will pop up where you can give
your connection an optional Name, Group and Background image. Click `Save` to close when done.

and `mstscex.exe` which are developed and maintained by Devolutions
(https://github.com/Devolutions/MsRdpEx)
